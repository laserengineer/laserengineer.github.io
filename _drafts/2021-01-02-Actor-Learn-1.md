## Recap of Modular Applications in LabVIEW

> * High Cohesion
>   * Each module should only have a definitive purpose
> * Low Coupling
>   * A module shouldn't be dependent on another module in order to operate.

* Cohension is about how the module is written (intra-module) and self ccompleteness for single task
    * Readability
    * Maintainability
    * Reusability


* Coupling is about how the module relies on other modules (inter-module )
    * Maintainability
    * Testability (unit testing)
    * Readability
