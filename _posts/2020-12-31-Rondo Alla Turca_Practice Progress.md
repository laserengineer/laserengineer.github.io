### About Ronda Alla Turca

The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 / 300i, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a piano sonata in three movements. Mozart likely composed the sonata while in Vienna or Salzburg by around 1783, although Paris and dates as far back as 1778 have also been suggested.

The sonata consists of three movements:

1. Andante grazioso
2. Menuetto
3. Alla turca â€“ Allegretto

Rondo Alla Turca is the last moment of the sonata, popularly known as the "Turkish Rondo" or "Turkish March", is often heard on its own and is one of Mozart's best-known piano pieces.
