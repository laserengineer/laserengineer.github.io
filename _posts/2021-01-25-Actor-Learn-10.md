>The source video did not provide every details of the Chat Room Implementation since there will too much trivial. The writer will cover original video content and try to finish the application. The "LabVIEW Sample Code" will contain Tom's code and writer's attempt. Since this is writer's first actor application code, there will are a lot room to improve.


### Top 5 Actor Overrides

Tops 5 Actor overrides lists are following:

1. Pre Launch Init.vi
2. Actor Core.vi
3. Stop Core.vi
4. Handle Last Ack Core.vi
5. Handle Error.vi

#### Pre Launch Init.vi

Inside Actor.vi, we can find the **Pre Launch Init.vi**, the very top level implementation doesn't do anything. It is a placeholder, an empty diagram.

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Pre Launch Init2.png"> </p>

One of the implementation is to create different user event to update User Interface in Pre Launch Init.vi. If any error happens, we need follow the best practices to call the "Destroy Events"

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Pre Launch Init3.png"> </p>

Inside "Destroy Events", send the stop event and clean the event reference.

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Pre Launch Init4.png"> </p>

One thing we **MUST NOT** do is

<span style="color:red">
<span style="font-size: 150%">
DO NOT try to launch nested actors in the pre Launch Init.vi, which will hang system.
</span>
</span>

#### Actor Core.vi

Actor Core will not launch if any happened in Pre Launch Init.vi, and will clean up the reference that open in Pre Launch Init.vi.

Again,
* The Actor Class Private contains the QMS "Cluster" Data
* The Message Class, Contains the QMS "Case Structure" and parameters pass to the QMS "Case Structure"

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Actor Core.png"> </p>

One of the implementation is to use Actor Core as UI.
The event handling loop is used in Actor Core to handle
* Value Changes to send message
* User Event to update UI

If we create reference want to pass the core, we need to do it before the parent Implementation of Actor Core.

The Chat Window Model Actor Core is not used as UI
<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Actor Core3.png"> </p>

Before We launch nested actor, a few abstract messages are added nested Actor private data, "Chat Room Name" and nested actor Enqueuer.
UI Class is bundle into Calling Actor "Chat Window Model" private data, do it before parent implementation

#### Handle Error.vi

Error Handle is inside actor core
 <p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Error Handle.png"> </p>

By default, it is empty code but to stop the actor. Sometimes an override is needed prevent certain error to shut down whole actor. We c

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Error Handle2.png"> </p>

We could add simple error handler dialog and case structure to handle the errors. Apart from error 43 which is *Open/Create/Replace File Vi when File Dialog is Cancelled*

DETT = Desktop Execution Trace Toolkit (Used for debugging)

#### Stop Core.vi

The Stop Core is also found inside Actor Core

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Stop Core.png"> </p>

This VI is going to send out STOP MESSAGE to all of the Nested Actors. If a Calling Actor stops, all of its nested actors will stop by **default**.

We may also need to stop any help loops or clean up references caused by your Actors Core.

#### Handle Last Ack Core.vi

Handle Last Ack Core.vi overrides is essentially message overrides, if we tunneled into Actor Core. We send Last Ack.vi at the end of a nested Actor.vi

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Handle Last Call.png"> </p>

Receive Message.vi Event-> Do.vi -> Last Ack:Do.vi -> Handle last Ack ->

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Handle Last Call2.png"> </p>

Three things will be sent with "Send Last Ack.vi"
1. Last data appeared in that nested actor
2. Nested Actor Enqueuer
3. The error status of the nested Actor

<p align="Left"> <img src="/assets/images/LabVIEW Actor Framework/10/Handle Last Call3.png"> </p>

The Calling Actor is going to purge its registry, check who is my nested Actors, if the Enqueuer match any of the registry. The Enqueuer will be removed.

The next is Handle Last Ack Core.vi
