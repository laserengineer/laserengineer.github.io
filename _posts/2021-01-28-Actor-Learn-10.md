Learning notes for LabVIEW Interface

## An Introduction to G interface

### What is an interface type
In General Context:

Software interface = the set of functions that one code module uses to request functionality from another module

In today's Context:

Interface = a new data type that defines a set of tasks that object can do without specifying how those tasks must be done

#### Basic Definition

Identity - State - Behavior

Three things go into making a class and decide the inheritance hierarchy as well as how classes related to each other.

* State is the internal data that a class stores that has the transitions that it moves through
* Behavior is the presentation that it the things/tasks Class can do
* Identity is the how the rest of system think of this object

Interface only defines:
* Identity
* Behavior

* An interface is a user-defined data type with encapsulation and inheritance
* An interface has all parts of a class except the private data control and the Call Parent Class Method node
* Class inherit methods from interfaces and then provide their **OWN** implementation (very similar to inherited from an abstract Class)

It do not have private data control.

* A Class defines an object's existence, behavior and it is a concrete thing that we know how to work/implement
* An Abstract class is the framework around it, it is a basic structure that the details will be filled later
* An interface doesn't even really talk to the structure. It says this is what I can do, this is a list of functionality. When a class has this interface, it can do these things
